Question 5 AD Privilege Discovery
Using the data set contained in this SANS Slingshot Linux image, find a reliable path from a Kerberoastable user to the Domain Admins group. What’s the user’s logon name (in username@domain.tld format)? Remember to avoid RDP as a control path as it depends on separate local privilege escalation flaws. .

CURLing Master Cranberry Pi terminal challenge
history
curl --http2-prior-knowledge http://localhost:8080/index.php
To turn the machine on, simply POST to this URL with parameter "status=on"

download image file https://download.holidayhackchallenge.com/HHC2018-DomainHack_2018-12-19.ova
attempted to spin-up vm in virtual-box but was unable to boot
re-downloaded image and attempted again with no success
after a suitable amount of hair pulling and switching from coffee to beer I realised it must be a configuration issue and not part of the challenge
changed os version from 32-bit to 64-bit and was happy to see the kernel loading
ran BloodHound then watched Raphael Mudge's BloodHound demo - BloodHound - Analyzing Active Directory Trust Relationships 
[More Info]

[Shortest path to Domain Admins from Kerberoastable users]
visually checked for shortest path remembering to avoid RDP as a control path as it depends on separate local privilege escalation flaws.
shortest path coincidentally also the only path without RDP as a control path.
User's login name "LDUBEJ00320@AD.KRINGLECASTLE.COM"

Question 6 Badge Manipulation
Bypass the authentication mechanism associated with the room near Pepper Minstix. A sample employee badge is available. What is the access control number revealed by the door authentication panel?

using the python script to convert to xml
python evtx_dump.py ho-ho-no.evtx > xmasdump.xml

started running runtoanswer and running iterations of usernames
got lucky second go "minty.candycane"

What is the access control number revealed by the door authentication panel?
Opened and viewed Alabaster Snowball's sample employee badge
followed Pepper Minstix hints to https://www.owasp.org/index.php/SQL_Injection_Bypassing_WAF#Auth_Bypass
https://www.the-qrcode-generator.com/

Created Sql Injection within QR code generator (Ended up trying about 50 variations... I can't wait to learn how I should have approached it to progress!!!

With Burp Suite running generated error code 
{"data":"EXCEPTION AT (LINE 96 \"user_info = query(\"SELECT first_name,last_name,enabled FROM employees WHERE authorized = 1 
AND uid = '{}' LIMIT 1\".format(uid))\"): (1064, u\"You have an error in your SQL syntax; check the manual that corresponds to your MariaDB server version for the right syntax to use near '' LIMIT 1' at line 1\")","request":false}

decided put the SQL injection on the back-burner spend some time on the maze for diversion.
following the maps acquired earlier completed the maze and found it dropped me out into the room on the other side of this challenge.
